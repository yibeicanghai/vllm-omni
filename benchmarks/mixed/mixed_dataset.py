"""Dataset / request-list construction for the mixed-task benchmark.

Builds a single shuffled list of ``MixedRequest`` spanning i2t / t2i / it2i in
the counts the caller asked for, with it2i ``bot_task`` sampled (weighted)
across recaption / think / think_recaption. Two sources:

* ``random`` (default): synthetic prompts + a placeholder image for i2t/it2i.
  Zero external dependencies — enough to drive the scheduler and collect
  latency / throughput stats.
* ``custom``: a JSONL file (``--dataset-path``) where each line declares its
  own ``task`` / ``prompt`` / ``image_path`` / ``bot_task`` / generation knobs.
  The per-task pools are sampled (cycling) up to the requested counts.

The shuffle is a true ``random.shuffle`` over the merged list (controlled by
``--seed``), so the three task types are interleaved rather than sent in
blocks — which is what exercises the DTPS mixed-scheduling path.

    allocation + resolution allocation + shuffle) is reproducible. RNG draws
    that are disabled by default (``gen_resolution_weights is None``) are
    skipped entirely, so a run that doesn't use the resolution feature gets the
    exact same bot_task + shuffle sequence as before.

    ``bot_task_sampling`` / ``gen_resolution_sampling`` are ``proportional``
    (exact counts via largest remainder, default) or ``random`` (independent
    weighted draws, matches weights only in expectation). ``group_order`` gives
    the concatenation order of the i2t/t2i/it2i groups when ``shuffle`` is
    False (it is ignored when ``shuffle`` is True since the merge is then
    randomized). ``gen_resolution_weights`` overrides ``config.width`` /
    ``config.height`` per t2i/it2i request — each of t2i and it2i is allocated
    resolutions independently per the ratio; a custom row's explicit
    ``width``/``height`` still wins.

    ``randomize_input`` (``--randomize-input``, ``random`` dataset only) varies
    the *input* side per request to approximate real-world diversity: a prompt
    drawn from a short→long pool per task type (i2t / t2i / it2i); for i2t /
    it2i a unique varied-content image generated at a resolution drawn from
    512x512 / 1024x1024 / 1280x720. All draws come from the same seeded ``rng``
    *after* the bot_task + resolution allocations, so a run with
    ``randomize_input=False`` keeps the exact same bot_task + resolution +
